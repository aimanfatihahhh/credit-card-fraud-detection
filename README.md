## 🖋 Background:
*   Engaging in the development of a sophisticated fraud detection system to secure credit card transactions.
*   Utilizing a comprehensive dataset that captures the essence of genuine and fraudulent credit card transactions.

## 🎯 Objective:
*   To develop a robust model capable of detecting fraudulent transactions with high accuracy, thereby reducing financial losses and enhancing customer trust.

## 🧾 Dataset Overview:
* [Transaction Details](#-transaction-details): Information on transaction amount, time, and other relevant features.
* [Fraud Indicators](#-fraud-indicators): Characteristics and patterns observed in fraudulent transactions.
<br><br>

## ⚙ Data Preparation:
[Data Preparation](#-data-preparation)
*   Careful preprocessing and cleaning of data to ensure quality inputs for model building and analysis. In this project, we include row deletion due to a small amount of missing data.

## 🏗 Model Building:
[Model Building](#-model-building)
*   Implementation of advanced machine learning algorithms, including deep learning models for accurate fraud prediction. We implemented Logistic Regression which is designed for binary classification problems. In this project, our data includes binary classification of weather the data is classified as Normal Transactions or Fraudulent Transactions.

## 📉 Model Evaluation:
[Model Evaluation](#-model-evaluation)
*   Comprehensive evaluation using accuracy score. This method calculates the proportion of correct predictions made by the model out of all predictions made. The accuracy score is a common evaluation metric for classification problems and is particularly straightforward and intuitive.

## 📈 Results and Insights:
*   [Detection Accuracy](#-detection-accuracy): High precision and recall rates achieved in identifying fraudulent transactions.
*   [Feature Importance](#-feature-importance): Insights into the most critical indicators of fraudulent activity.

## 💼 Strategic Recommendations:
*   [Fraud Prevention Measures](#-fraud-prevention-measures): Implement advanced monitoring and real-time detection systems.
*   [Customer Awareness](#-customer-awareness): Educate customers on safeguarding against fraud.
